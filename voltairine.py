He lived in New York City, where he became involved in the anarchist movement. He was the one-time lover and lifelong friend of anarchist Emma Goldman. In 1892, undertaking an act of propaganda of the deed, Berkman made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate businessman Henry Clay Frick, for which he served 14 years in prison. His experience in prison was the basis for his first book, Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist.\nAfter his release from prison, Berkman served as editor of Goldman\'s anarchist journal, Mother Earth, and later established his own journal, The Blast. In 1917, Berkman and Goldman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiracy against the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country\'s Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing their opposition to the Soviet\'s use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries.\n\n:books: **Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist **: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-berkman-prison-memoirs-of-an-anarchist\n:books: **Bolsheviks Shooting Anarchists** with Emma Goldman: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-alexander-berkman-bolsheviks-shooting-anarchists \n:books: **The Russian Tragedy (A Review and An Outlook)**: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-berkman-the-russian-tragedy-a-review-and-an-outlook \n:books: **What Is Communist Anarchism?**: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-berkman-what-is-communist-anarchism \nhttp://www.gooseberrycollective.net/bots/berkman.png')

As a result, under mutualism every meaningfully social relation will have the form of an anarchic encounter between equally unique individuals—free absolutes—no matter what layers of convention we pile on it." \n\n—Shawn P. Wilbur, *"Two-Gun Mutualism and The Golden Rule"* \n\nMutualism is an anti-capitalist economic theory and anarchist school of thought that advocates a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in a "freed market".\nMutualists believe that it is the state enforcement of capitalist property relations that alienates the working class from the means of production and subsistence and allows exploitation in the forms of profit, interest, and rents. Therefore, they wish to see private property abolished and replaced with possession-and-use, "the land to the cultivator, the mine to the miner, the tool to the laborer."\n\n:books: **Recommended reading**: :books: \n\n**[A Mutualist FAQ]** http://www.mutualist.org/id23.html\n **[Markets Not Capitalism]** https://goo.gl/YM4Gx1 \n**[What is Property?]** https://goo.gl/kkAgKx \n:books: **In-Depth**: :books:\n **[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]** https://goo.gl/3rcWrn \n**[Kevin Carson\'s blog with links to his books]** http://mutualist.blogspot.ca/ \n**[humanispherian\'s blog with translations of Proudhon]** https://www.mutualism.info/ \n:books: **Further reading**: :books: \n**[C4SS Studies]** https://c4ss.org/content/category/studies \n**[Kevin Carson\'s suggested reading list]** http://www.mutualist.org/id6.html')
